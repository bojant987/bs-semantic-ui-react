A work in progress Bucklescript and ReasonReact set of bindings for [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com). 

## Introduction

This is very early work in progress that I build to fulfill my need. But I hope it is a clean enough basis for anyone to participate (there are loads of components with hundreds of properties in Semantic UI React).
